Coherent Rendering for Augmented Reality is concerned with seamlessly blending the virtual world and real world in real time. We are interested in applying real-world light to virtual objects. This implies the measurement of the real-world lighting, also known as photometric registration. In this project we implement a method to estimate high quality illumination using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our represention of light model of real world is based on spherical harmonics representation. The aim of this project is to make augmentations photorealistic while removing any constraints in the environment.
